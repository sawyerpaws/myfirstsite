      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="first-paragraph">This is me and my cat Sawyer.<br> Hi, my name is Anna. I am a new web developer. <br> I love to write and read. I am currently reading two books. I also write in a personal
        growth journal, which helps me reflect on my actions,feelings and aspirations. I love to cook from scratch. My favorite food is Japanese tonkotsu ramen. I currently live in California. I graduated from university in 2014. My most recent job
        was at a tech company.
        Currently, I am taking a Bootcamp course in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I want to learn how to code and create websites. I have come to find coding is very exciting. Learning new skills is very important for the health of your brain. Currently,
        the whole
        world is living through a pandemic. Mental health and body health is super important right now. It has been very tough. Some days are much better than others. But nonetheless, we must keep moving. This year is a test of strength, resilience
        and faith in everything that we live through. </p>

        <p class="birthday-text">Here is a picture capturing Sawyer's pure bliss on his very special day. Sawyer is the best cat. I walk Sawyer outside on a leash almost everyday. It is very important for his mental health. Outside Sawyer likes to
          hunt gophers and birds, I do not let him grab the animals but I do
          let him stake them out and prance. Sawyer also likes butterflies and bumblebees, he likes to try and catch them by jump-running towards them and extending his paws. We also play hide and seek/chase together. Sawyer loves me. He follows me
          everywehre I go and talks to me constantly, we talk a lot. We talk about the world, when he last ate, when he will eat again, how much he loves me, how much I love him, about the tresspassing cat out in the yard that I won't let him fight,
          about the racoons that are trying to get into the trash bins at night, our memories of the snow, how soft our new wool blanket is, when he will eat again, whether he can have some bone broth now, where he can have some bone broth later, how
          much he loves me and how much I love him. Sawyer has a special diet. I make it for him every 2 weeks. I am trying to help Sawyer be happy and healthy. </p>
